2019-01-08 22:48:40	zamza	well, he already accepted a plea bargain i guess

2019-01-08 22:48:45	rcf	But the outcome was not unforseeable. 
2019-01-08 22:48:47	zamza	that dude is innocent

2019-01-08 22:49:07	zamza	he did hide the bodies
2019-01-08 22:49:10	zamza	and he did have an affair
2019-01-08 22:49:11	alad	DoomPatrol: for some narcissists probably not
2019-01-08 22:49:14	zamza	and he's a freaking idiot
2019-01-08 22:49:24	zamza	and he killed his wife
2019-01-08 22:49:25	+DoomPatrol	alad: yeah :\ weird eh?
2019-01-08 22:49:32	zamza	but he didn't kill his two daughters, no way
2019-01-08 22:49:49	alad	so I once heard this story

2019-01-08 22:50:26	rcf	zamza: and in doing that, he sealed his fate. You don't kill one person and hide a bunch of bodies and then lie and lie ane lie to everybody involved and then have everyone believe that you were less culpable after you finally break under the pressure of solid evidence.

2019-09-16 22:16:11	sangy	dmc: the bot didn't find a vulnerability. It just checks a lock file and sees if there is any new dependencies. Verifying a PR was basically seeing if it could be auto merge and running regular CI things

2019-09-16 22:17:10	sangy	now something that's cooler was the DGC when a bot actually found a vulnerability, exploited it and then wrote a patch for it

2019-09-26 23:57:50	+sloth	in australia you can only own 20 centrefire guns and 300 rimfire guns on a regular license but i wanted to be able to own up to 500 centrefire guns and 1,000 rimfire guns so i got a collectors condition put on my license which requires me to be part of a collectors organization in a registered gun club
2019-09-26 23:58:10	+sloth	my gunclub messed up the paperwork and didn't renew my membership so they sent a notice to the police that i had discontinued
2019-09-26 23:58:16	+sloth	so when my license came up for renewal
2019-09-26 23:58:35	+sloth	it was declined because i did not have the requirements to have it
2019-09-26 23:58:43	paulguy	that's a lot of guns
2019-09-26 23:58:45	+sloth	so i had to go to my club and pay my dues

2019-09-26 23:59:08	+sloth	and the police then said i had left my club so i had to regain accreditation as a collector but my club said i already was one
2019-09-26 23:59:09	+mpan	paulguy: especially mates.
2019-09-26 23:59:13	paulguy	mpan, gotta be hard on those disability fraudsters I guess.
2019-09-26 23:59:37	+sloth	so i had to get a certificate from my club that i was an active and current member and that i had paid my dues and the rest was a clerical error
2019-09-26 23:59:44	+sloth	and get it to the police the same week
2019-09-26 23:59:50	+sloth	however my club is only open on the weekends
2019-09-27 00:00:00	+mpan	paulguy: I do understand the reasoning behind the law. In general case it makes sense. But there are clearly incurable cases and there is no exception for them. And there is no normal renewal procedure.

2019-09-27 00:02:43	+sloth	also i had to get new ID photos taken and be fingerprinted against cause they had temporarily suspended my license for a whopping 2 minutes on the monday when they "hadn't received the paperwork" by the "end of the week" which is both COB friday and 11:59pm sunday
2019-09-27 00:02:53	+sloth	before they actually had an reinstated it
2019-09-27 00:03:19	+mpan	So for 2 minutes you were a criminal?
2019-09-27 00:03:41	+sloth	no because if your license is suspended they issue you an order to turn in your firearms
2019-09-27 00:03:49	+sloth	and if you don't respond to that, then you're a criminal
2019-09-27 00:03:59	+sloth	but my license was reinstated 36 hours before it was suspended

2019-09-27 00:04:10	+sloth	so i was technically never unlicensed so never got the order to surrendur

2019-09-27 00:19:56	+sloth	beest: well the problem is if you don't kill em first shot they fuck off and you either have to let em suffer or track the bastards for hours
2019-09-27 00:20:15	mnrmnaugh	i fond the mechanics and physysics interesting. never shot more than those .177 bb slugs
2019-09-27 00:20:32	+sloth	i decided to start overkilling on roos when i was using .308 and the round came down and scalped the root
2019-09-27 00:20:35	+sloth	*roo
2019-09-27 00:20:40	mnrmnaugh	sloth up your skill points

2019-09-27 00:21:01	gehidore	at least you did though, that gives you positive points

2019-09-27 00:21:34	+sloth	so i'd rather have a flatter round like .243 or something big and heavy
2019-09-27 00:22:04	+sloth	tell you what i was out hunting boar and i had a .303 with a custom load 215gr projectile
2019-09-27 00:22:05	mnrmnaugh	gehidore lets go have a "hunting accident", like cheney
2019-09-27 00:22:13	+sloth	2700fps at the muzzle
2019-09-27 00:22:21	+sloth	and a rabbit popped up maybe 25y away
2019-09-27 00:22:25	mnrmnaugh	tho i guess the forest eats it anyway
2019-09-27 00:22:31	+sloth	and i was like "oh i'll get that real quick" and fired not thinking

2019-09-27 19:00:02	hellsenberg	commanderjroc: I had two classes for the main window with the canvas (to draw things on) and also a "settings" class (which was a panel with all the buttons and jspinners and whatever)

2019-09-27 19:06:14	hellsenberg	this is when I thought of turning that mess inside out. I looked up a bit, saw the MVC pattern (we did not learn any patterns in class, ever) and saw that java uses something more like M(VC): view and controller are rather coupled together
2019-09-27 19:06:37	hellsenberg	and I broke everything, and then made it work again, and then it was all much cleaner.
2019-09-27 19:07:51	hellsenberg	the settings jpanel was an attribute of the controller, so event handling, as well as that detach thing, was just direct.

It slowly became unenforced after 1990s and now any penalties have been removed too. It exists merely because the parliament and ministries continue to fail to redefine many procedures to not require “adres zameldowania” (the address under which you are registered).

2019-09-27 19:45:08	novns	QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2
2019-09-27 19:45:11	@alad	apart from the "gtk2" qstyle for the theme, I guess...
2019-09-27 19:45:12	@alad	yeah
2019-09-27 19:45:25	novns	I use this one, so qt is using gtk themes
2019-09-27 19:45:28	@alad	not sure if that counts for mouse doubleclick settings and such
2019-09-27 19:45:47	paulguy	i like that qt themes let you define colors
2019-09-27 19:45:49	paulguy	gtk themes do not
2019-09-27 19:46:10	TheRealRob	thats qpalette actually
2019-09-27 19:46:40	paulguy	however it's done, it seems to pull it off.
2019-09-27 19:47:00	@grawity	gtk2 themes used to allow this, gtk3 themes don't
2019-09-27 19:47:11	TheRealRob	yeah, qstyle has complete control over the drawing of widgets
2019-09-27 19:47:16	novns	gtk3 themes are css
2019-09-27 19:47:20	TheRealRob	gtk3 is just css
2019-09-27 19:47:21	TheRealRob	ye
2019-09-27 19:47:22	commanderjroc	ur mom is css
2019-09-27 19:47:40	commanderjroc	and your dad is html
2019-09-27 19:47:41	TheRealRob	there is a qt css implementation aswell, qss

2019-09-27 19:47:48	@phrik	mpan: Bingpot!
2019-09-27 19:47:49	TheRealRob	you can start any qt app w/ a styleshit
2019-09-27 19:48:17	novns	you can start any gtk app with your custom css
2019-09-27 19:48:38	TheRealRob	yeah... thats a given, since gtk3 is all about being css only
2019-09-27 19:49:03	commanderjroc	I wish css would die in an epic fire
2019-09-27 19:49:07	TheRealRob	same
2019-09-27 19:49:13	TheRealRob	at least for real applications
2019-09-27 19:49:16	TheRealRob	in the web its fine
2019-09-27 19:49:18	TheRealRob	stay there
2019-09-27 19:49:31	novns	and you can edit css for any running gtk app, if you enable gtk inspector
2019-09-27 19:49:58	commanderjroc	no
2019-09-27 19:50:01	commanderjroc	everywhere
2019-09-27 19:50:11	MrElendig	css really isn't that bad
2019-09-27 19:50:14	commanderjroc	EVERY FUCKING WHERE, CSS IS NOT TO BE RESURECTED AFTER IT DIES
2019-09-27 19:50:22	novns	css is rather good
2019-09-27 19:50:24	commanderjroc	css isnt bad till you write a large ERP system
2019-09-27 19:50:39	commanderjroc	and then you realize how bad it is to use everywhere
2019-09-27 19:50:48	novns	just don't write one
2019-09-27 19:50:48	commanderjroc	SASS makes it a bit better
2019-09-27 19:50:55	TheRealRob	css is good for what its intended for, and bad for what its not intended for
2019-09-27 19:50:59	commanderjroc	novns: then I wont put food on my plate
2019-09-27 19:51:08	commanderjroc	gotta make a living somehow

2019-09-28 21:13:49	deltasquared	hmm, most posix functions return -1 and errno on failure right?
2019-09-28 21:13:59	paulguy	maybe?
2019-09-28 21:14:18	+mpan	deltasquared: yes, though `errno` should only be checked AFTER you know the function has failed.
2019-09-28 21:14:20	jelle	oh man errno
2019-09-28 21:14:25	deltasquared	(just thinking up a quick macro to avoid "if (!func(...)) { return 1; }" type boilerplate
2019-09-28 21:14:30	+mpan	deltasquared: and some may return `0` on “soft” failures.
2019-09-28 21:14:43	deltasquared	so in other words RTFM :)
2019-09-28 21:14:49	+mpan	Not `!func(…)`, as many functions may return a positive value on success.

2019-11-17 13:50:56	rodl	and i don't know what the answer is, even if there is one nor what anyone should do about it
2019-11-17 13:51:17	rodl	but someone should probably conider it before AI gets too far ahead of us
2019-11-17 13:51:38	rodl	coz at that point we are talking about something, a new form of life maybe, that can't get turned off
2019-11-17 13:52:09	rodl	and last i looked out in nature, and anyone can do this research for themself, nature isn't too kind to anything that gets 'leverage' over another critter
2019-11-17 13:52:21	rodl	usually not how shit works, down to the cellular level even
2019-11-17 13:53:05	rodl	it's complex coz on the other side of that coin, we seem to be having trouble surviving in space, heck even getting to mars as a colony, cancer, blood flow, reproduction etc
2019-11-17 13:53:45	rodl	so maybe this tech is somehow gonna save us in some form, so we can explore out there, not go extinct, i don't know i really don't
2019-11-17 13:54:40	rodl	past year we have had numerous asteroids fly by us one was a city killer, that's enough to mess the weather up bad enough to throw us into a ice age which would change maps as we know them
2019-11-17 13:57:00	rodl	imagine if that asteroid would have hit say near yellowstone, that right there would probably have been enough to release the pressure in the magma chamber, that right there would have most likely changed the US as we know it, killing hundreds of millions over a decade or less
2019-11-17 13:57:52	rodl	coz the magma in that specific chamber is a form of magman that is brutal ash to breathe in, microscopic glass basically, you don't want to breathe it for even a single minute, it shreds your lungs

2020-04-12 17:39:25	beest	for a while i had "flying" dreams where i mostly just kinda levitated by kicking my feet as if to swim
2020-04-12 17:39:46	+mpan	I have three kinds of those.
2020-04-12 17:39:51	+mpan	Well, four actually.
2020-04-12 17:40:21	+mpan	Sometimes I run fast enough that I basically levitate over the ground by making jumps many meters long or not touching the ground for a long time.
2020-04-12 17:40:38	+mpan	Sometimes I need to get out of some apartment and I simply leave it by the window and fall slowly.
2020-04-12 17:41:16	+mpan	The third and the rarest dream is actually flying as if one had wings. There is hardly anything as pleasant as fall down on scared peasants running for their lives.
2020-04-12 17:41:39	+mpan	And the fourth option are LD experiences, during which levitating is a quite normal activity.
2020-04-12 17:42:53	mnrmnaugh	lucids are great
2020-04-12 17:42:56	beest	my lucid dreaming is infrequent but it happens

2020-04-12 19:57:10	Foxboron	bookworm: Foxboron is from Foxboro Hot Tubs, which is a 60s garage rock side project from Green Day
2020-04-12 19:57:14	Foxboron	It should tell you a lot about me :p
2020-04-12 19:57:30	bookworm	nicks by definition tend to be somewhat stupid or bad puns.... as long as it isn't offensive who cares?
2020-04-12 19:57:49	Foxboron	bookworm: covid20 is a nick intended to create a reaction.
2020-04-12 19:57:59	bookworm	or just someone having fun?
2020-04-12 19:58:11	bookworm	I mean it's not remotely offensive
2020-04-12 19:58:21	Foxboron	Im not claiming it's *offensive*
2020-04-12 19:58:25	Foxboron	I'm saying it's bad taste
2020-04-12 19:58:36	Foxboron	And clearly, only done to cause a reaction.
2020-04-12 19:58:46	bookworm	people always choose a nick either because they think it's funny or because they identify with it
2020-04-12 19:58:52	bookworm	I mean look at alads nicks...
2020-04-12 19:58:57	Foxboron	This is neither :)
2020-04-12 20:00:32	bookworm	well, just because someone doesn't get a joke doesn't mean that others do not see it
2020-04-12 20:01:01	bookworm	there are a bunch of people with sarcastic nicks as well, not everyone likes those. Nor puns for  that matter which certain people can laugh about all day long
2020-04-12 20:01:04	Foxboron	You can't defend everything done to cause a reaction as a "joke"  that is silly
2020-04-12 20:01:26	bookworm	why is naming oneself as virus+1 an attention grab?
2020-04-12 20:01:33	bookworm	I mean it's a meme, sure but that's about it
2020-04-12 20:01:35	Foxboron	because of ircnick and tor-sasl
2020-04-12 20:01:40	bookworm	I don't see why that is causing such a fuss
2020-04-12 20:01:51	Foxboron	Look at his reaction :p
2020-04-12 20:01:51	bookworm	I didn't look at the irc nick
2020-04-12 20:02:04	dmcmnaugh	邏
2020-04-12 20:02:05	bookworm	they are an idiot, sure. I'm not defending the character
2020-04-12 20:02:05	Foxboron	I did a complete assessment, which included a /whoid
2020-04-12 20:02:14	beest	dmcmnaugh++
2020-04-12 20:02:16	Foxboron	then based my entire predisposition of the character on that

2020-04-12 20:06:32	+mpan	bookworm: one either has a sense that tells you if someone is going to cause problems, or you don’t. There is no reason to trying to put that into precise terms — it’s social experience. Foxboron obviously has that.
