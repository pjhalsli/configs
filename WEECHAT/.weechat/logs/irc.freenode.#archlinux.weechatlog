2019-01-08 09:31:32	im0nde	Hello, I'm looking for a recommendation for full disk encryption. I use arch on my laptop and have private data that should be protected in case of theft. (not only /home, whole disk)
2019-01-08 09:31:51	im0nde	I'm a bit confused by all the options. What is the "standard" here?
2019-01-08 09:31:51	dp	The wiki has you covered

2019-01-08 20:54:44	hotbobby	if my esp is in /efi and my kernel is in /boot/vmlinux-linux, what is the path of the kernel relative to the ESP?
2019-01-08 20:55:03	hotbobby	i cant figure out how to make a systemd-boot entry because i made my efi in /efi and not /boot/efi
2019-01-08 20:56:05	Namarrgon	your kernel needs to be on the ESP if you want to use systemd-boot
2019-01-08 20:56:18	Foxboron	or you can just objdump it all
2019-01-08 20:56:18	Namarrgon	it can't load it from any other fs
2019-01-08 20:56:26	Foxboron	objcopy*
2019-01-08 20:56:46	hotbobby	so i need to move my esp to /boot/efi
2019-01-08 20:56:51	Namarrgon	either use grub or mount the esp to /boot
2019-01-08 20:56:55	hotbobby	but then /boot/ -is- the ESP
2019-01-08 20:56:59	Namarrgon	sure

2019-01-08 20:57:19	rcf	That's the recommended way of doing it.
2019-01-08 20:57:27	hotbobby	thats where it belongs? i usually mount it to /boot/efi because thats what it is. but i also usually use grub....

2019-09-18 19:00:07	demonicmaniac3	geosmin: vm.dirty_ratio is the absolute maximum amount of system memory that can be filled with dirty pages before everything must get committed to disk. When the system gets to this point all new I/O blocks until dirty pages have been written to disk. This is often the source of long I/O pauses, but is a safeguard against too much data being cached unsafely in memory.

2020-03-14 13:38:33	j0hannes_	I have some problems keeping my system in sleep mode, i.e. it will wake up automatically again. It does not happen with the LTS kernel but only the current one. In the kernel log I see messages like "Disable of device-initiated U1 failed.", but the only usb devices connected are a keyboard and a logitech receiver for the mouse.

This is how one can boot external medias without the need to fiddle with custom boot entries.

I saw the package on Arch is flagged out of date, so I thought you could use the heads up.
