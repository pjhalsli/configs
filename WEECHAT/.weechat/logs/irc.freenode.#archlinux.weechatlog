2019-01-08 09:31:32	im0nde	Hello, I'm looking for a recommendation for full disk encryption. I use arch on my laptop and have private data that should be protected in case of theft. (not only /home, whole disk)
2019-01-08 09:31:51	im0nde	I'm a bit confused by all the options. What is the "standard" here?

2019-01-08 20:54:44	hotbobby	if my esp is in /efi and my kernel is in /boot/vmlinux-linux, what is the path of the kernel relative to the ESP?
2019-01-08 20:55:03	hotbobby	i cant figure out how to make a systemd-boot entry because i made my efi in /efi and not /boot/efi
2019-01-08 20:56:05	Namarrgon	your kernel needs to be on the ESP if you want to use systemd-boot
2019-01-08 20:56:18	Foxboron	or you can just objdump it all
2019-01-08 20:56:18	Namarrgon	it can't load it from any other fs
2019-01-08 20:56:26	Foxboron	objcopy*
2019-01-08 20:56:46	hotbobby	so i need to move my esp to /boot/efi
2019-01-08 20:56:51	Namarrgon	either use grub or mount the esp to /boot
2019-01-08 20:56:55	hotbobby	but then /boot/ -is- the ESP
2019-01-08 20:56:59	Namarrgon	sure

2019-01-08 20:57:19	rcf	That's the recommended way of doing it.
2019-01-08 20:57:27	hotbobby	thats where it belongs? i usually mount it to /boot/efi because thats what it is. but i also usually use grub....

2019-09-16 22:40:08	Superfox_il_volp	I think gnome network manager is missing an implicit dependency on gnome-control-center. Without it the network manager simply refuses to open, without any explicit error message
2019-09-16 22:40:19	faceyneck	At what point do you throw in the towel and just do a clean install?

2019-09-18 19:00:07	demonicmaniac3	geosmin: vm.dirty_ratio is the absolute maximum amount of system memory that can be filled with dirty pages before everything must get committed to disk. When the system gets to this point all new I/O blocks until dirty pages have been written to disk. This is often the source of long I/O pauses, but is a safeguard against too much data being cached unsafely in memory.

2019-09-28 20:35:01	Hello71	multigpu isn't great. I think you still can't move windows between gpus on X
2019-09-28 20:35:11	Hello71	because it needs to move the rendering
2019-09-28 20:35:16	dandels	sil3nt: if the monitor isn't detected even when you have only the 5700 installed, then the issue is entirely unrelated to your multi-gpu setup.
2019-09-28 20:35:29	dandels	(which is a testable hypothesis)
2019-09-28 20:35:40	amrasouli79	Where is the alsa-base.conf in Arch linux?
2019-09-28 20:35:42	dandels	After that you proceed to solve it in the usual way of "monitor not detected"
2019-09-28 20:36:03	Namarrgon	!give amrasouli79 pkgfile
2019-09-28 20:36:04	@phrik	amrasouli79: pkgfile is a tool to find out what package owns a file, even if said package is not installed. pacman -S pkgfile; pkgfile -u; pkgfile <file>
2019-09-28 20:36:23	Namarrgon	amrasouli79: if pkgfile doesn't find it then it doesn't exist in the repos. what do you need it for?
2019-09-28 20:36:25	KoolAid1651	when I first did the ssh-keygen it asked me to enter a passphrase

I am a little bit confused about: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PRIME#PRIME_render_offload. I already installed x86-video-intel and mesa. Then I installed the package nvidia. And after that I installed nvidia-prime. Know I am a little bit

In the kernel log I see messages like "Disable of device-initiated U1 failed.", but the only usb devices connected are a keyboard and a logitech receiver for the mouse.
