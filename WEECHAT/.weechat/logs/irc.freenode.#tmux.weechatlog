2019-09-28 10:05:58	R2robot	you'd have to check  your terminfo
2019-09-28 10:06:01	whereistejas	screen, tmux, screen-256color, tmux-256color

2019-09-28 10:10:29	xeon	upto now, i tried screen, tmux, screen-256color, tmux-256color, xterm, xterm-256color
2019-09-28 10:11:16	xeon	R2robot: how to check terminfo?
2019-09-28 10:11:23	whereistejas	xeon: Which terminal are you using?
2019-09-28 10:11:38	whereistejas	You can find in the ~/.local folder
2019-09-28 10:11:40	whereistejas	I think
2019-09-28 10:11:42	xeon	xfce4-terminal
2019-09-28 10:12:00	whereistejas	why not just try that?
2019-09-28 10:12:13	whereistejas	But, don't set it from your tmux.conf
2019-09-28 10:12:20	whereistejas	try setting it from your bashrc
2019-09-28 10:12:43	whereistejas	(which, btw, I know is the improper way to do it)
2019-09-28 10:13:34	whereistejas	you can do something like TERM="xfce4-terminal" in your bashrc
2019-09-28 10:13:37	whereistejas	and source it
2019-09-28 10:13:43	R2robot	xeon: depends on your system, but if you can list the files that are in your ncurses package, you should see a terminfo directory
2019-09-28 10:16:42	R2robot	https://termbin.com/uggg   shows options I have
2019-09-28 10:17:06	R2robot	in my ncurses terminfo
2019-09-28 10:18:09	xeon	ah xterm-256color works.
2019-09-28 10:18:21	R2robot	boom
2019-09-28 10:18:54	R2robot	but you had that set earlier though
2019-09-28 10:18:56	xeon	the last time i tested with setting TERM shell variable, not changing the line in .tmux.conf
2019-09-28 10:19:03	R2robot	ahh
2019-09-28 10:19:12	R2robot	so setting it in tmux.conf worked?
2019-09-28 10:19:16	xeon	yes
2019-09-28 10:19:17	R2robot	cool
2019-09-28 10:19:29	xeon	thank you guys

2019-09-28 10:26:44	whereistejas	xeon: great news!

2019-09-28 10:32:49	xeon	so is there a good .tmux.config i can copy from?
2019-09-28 10:38:17	avih	start with a simple one. i suggest enabling mouse (set -g mouse on) and possibly adjusting the prefix to your liking, and maybe some colors. it's better to do that yourself after reading the docs than cargo culting stuff you don't understand or need/
2019-09-28 10:40:33	R2robot	i believe tmux distributes an example config that you could cherry pick from
2019-09-28 10:41:11	guardian	do you guys know why it takes ~4 seconds to launch tmux -f /dev/null under Cygwin, Windows 10 with 32GB or RAM running on a core i7
2019-09-28 10:41:51	R2robot	https://imgur.com/KCiYJWp
2019-09-28 10:42:20	avih	guardian: probably because tmux doesn't delete its socket files after it exits, and on startup if some exist then it takes longer to start, lus probably cygwin inherent slowness in some areas (fork, etc)
2019-09-28 10:43:03	avih	you can try rm -rf /tmp/tmux-* before you start tmux if you're sure a server is not currently running
2019-09-28 10:43:37	avih	s/lus/plus/
2019-09-28 10:44:30	guardian	avih: this is it, thansk!
2019-09-28 10:44:46	avih	deleted the tmp dir?
2019-09-28 10:44:54	guardian	rm -rf * :D
2019-09-28 10:44:59	guardian	yep rm -rf /tmp/tmux*
2019-09-28 10:45:06	avih	cool
2019-09-28 10:45:07	R2robot	lol
2019-09-28 10:45:10	guardian	them tmux -f /dev/null is mostly instant
2019-09-28 10:45:14	R2robot	rm -rf * ftw!
2019-09-28 10:45:16	R2robot	:P
2019-09-28 10:45:39	guardian	so, why doesn't tmux delete its socket file on exit?
2019-09-28 10:45:54	guardian	I bet there's a sound reason that explains it
2019-09-28 10:46:09	avih	because it's a hard problem to solve without introducing races on all edge \cases
2019-09-28 10:47:29	guardian	and what does tmux do with existing socket files if they exist? can't it just ignore them?
2019-09-28 10:49:29	●	tdy1 is now known as tdy
2019-09-28 10:49:40	avih	not sure. i guess it reuses them?

2019-09-28 10:52:49	guardian	anyways, it feels good starting the day learning something
2019-09-28 10:52:51	guardian	thank you!
2019-09-28 10:52:58	avih	guardian: fwiw, not sure which version is supplied by cygwin packages, but tmux build cleanly on cygwin and new tmux versions add useful features and fixes.
2019-09-28 10:53:17	guardian	it's 2.6
2019-09-28 10:53:38	avih	pretty old. i recomment switching to master or some RC or tag
2019-09-28 10:53:53	guardian	I'm curious whether "we" know the marketshare of different versions of tmux running in the wild
2019-09-28 10:54:39	avih	there's no telemetry if that's what you're asking :) but a safe base bet would be to check the version supplied with debian stable maybe?
2019-09-28 10:54:48	guardian	Ubuntu 18.04LTS (which is imho a reference) has 2.6.3
2019-09-28 10:55:52	guardian	debian stretch-backports (old stable backports) and buster (stable) have 2.8
2019-09-28 10:56:06	avih	anyway, 2.9+ (and ongoing) are considerably better is subtle and less subtle things, i recommend building a more recent version yourself if you're comfortable with building things and you use tmux a lot
2019-09-28 10:56:09	guardian	I don't really know the BSDs
2019-09-28 10:56:39	guardian	oh I am comfortable with building. It's just that I share my conf with other people and they use different versions :)
2019-09-28 10:56:40	avih	s/is/in/
2019-09-28 10:57:15	avih	well, unless you sync your tmux version, you're going to have incompatibilities anyway... because occasionally there are breaking config changes
2019-09-28 10:59:17	avih	re 2.6 on cygwin, i think that once 3.0 is out of the door cygwin should update their package. they should have with 2.8, but.. well.. they didn't :)
