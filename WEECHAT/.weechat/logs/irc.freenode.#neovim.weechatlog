2020-03-14 13:29:16	pippobaldo[m]	No and no (at least yet)
2020-03-14 13:29:47	BenJacksonGitter	i'm gathering feedback for my vimscript debugger (https://github.com/puremourning/vim-debug-adapter) ; it's going to need a lot of vim code changes, so i will need buyin from Bram. planning to write an RFC soon.
2020-03-14 13:30:10	⚡	BjrnLinseGitter[ is now curious how a debugger interacts with something like `if v:false | let x = ) | endif`
2020-03-14 13:30:55	BenJacksonGitter	the way vim internally does it isn't great. it just works on line numbers and function stack levels
2020-03-14 13:31:07	BenJacksonGitter	but, that's better than zip.

2020-03-14 13:31:52	BenJacksonGitter	https://github.com/puremourning/vim/tree/debugger if you're curious what i've been up to
2020-03-14 13:31:58	BjrnLinseGitter[	will it cover both vimscript1 and vimscript9 ?
2020-03-14 13:33:05	BjrnLinseGitter[	(hmm why cannot github get into "compare changes" from a commit?)
2020-03-14 13:34:23	BenJacksonGitter	https://github.com/vim/vim/compare/master...puremourning:debugger
2020-03-14 13:34:55	BenJacksonGitter	bfredl: yes it will (eventually) support vim9 script, though for now it doesn't because it's harder, and because vim9 script is still quite... unfinished
2020-03-14 13:35:27	BenJacksonGitter	strictly speaking, that's not true : i havent testing vim9 script; i don't know what it does with SOURCING_LNUM
2020-03-14 13:36:14	BjrnLinseGitter[	hmm I got the feeling that vim9 was "mostly done", except that bram won't want to commit to things being stable until 9.0 is releases.
2020-03-14 13:36:24	BjrnLinseGitter[	but maybe there is still a lotta bugs and edge cases and shit
2020-03-14 13:37:01	BjrnLinseGitter[	ahyes, he promised an interface/class system in the design document
2020-03-14 13:38:00	BenJacksonGitter	there's a number of things, and a number of basic stuff that doesn't work yet. i actually tried to write my debugger vimscript-land parts in vim9 to learn/test it,  ut it wasn't usable
2020-03-14 13:38:28	BenJacksonGitter	or it was, but the (set of things that work) and the (set of things that don't) weren't clear enough yet

2020-03-14 13:39:42	BenJacksonGitter	so i noped out of it and wrote the nub in normal vimscript (version 4() https://github.com/puremourning/vim-debug-adapter/blob/master/runtime/nub.vim
2020-03-14 13:41:48	BenJacksonGitter	of course, i have paid no attention to the myriad #ifdefs, so nothing works https://travis-ci.org/github/puremourning/vim/builds/662368478?utm_medium=notification&utm_source=email
2020-03-14 13:42:10	BjrnLinseGitter[	aha, so ex commands that references locals do not work? (if the ex command is not compiled)
2020-03-14 13:47:03	BjrnLinseGitter[	It is the real main reason we choose to use lua instead. We don't have the manpower to both maintain a language runtime and an editor :P
2020-03-14 13:47:22	BjrnLinseGitter[	still if the zyx-i experiment had played out it would have been nice. But alas, we can't get all the nice things.
2020-03-14 13:48:22	BenJacksonGitter	i think it's only ex-commands that take expr1
2020-03-14 13:48:31	BenJacksonGitter	which isn't _that_ many iirc

2020-03-14 13:54:40	BjrnLinseGitter[	ayhes, vim9script can into generics, like `let var : list<list<int>>`. Reminds me of using java arrays for the first time.
2020-03-14 13:55:57	BenJacksonGitter	i thinkt typing the language explicitly is a good thing, though it's likely to put off a lot of bad or novice programmers who think otherwise
2020-03-14 13:56:22	BenJacksonGitter	it's modelled i guess on typescript-style, so i guess bad programmers are used to it

2020-03-14 14:14:39	BjrnLinseGitter[	though remacs is not so different from (early) neovim. They remove C code and replace it with rust. We just removed a lot of C code :)
2020-03-14 14:15:57	BenJacksonGitter	personally find it much faster to write c than lua
2020-03-14 14:16:38	BenJacksonGitter	not least because i'm not super familiar with lua, but i find the tooling for statically typed languages is way better. iirc i was unable to find any good tooling for lua
2020-03-14 14:17:29	BenJacksonGitter	plus i can confidently refactor compiled, statically typed code; wheras refactoring dynamic code is super scary

2020-03-14 14:18:51	BenJacksonGitter	very regrettably, what we teach in schools is: design an object model, bunch of interfaces, APIs and abstractions before you learned anything about the problem space
2020-03-14 14:19:03	BenJacksonGitter	it's backwards
2020-03-14 14:20:13	BjrnLinseGitter[	hmm I don't feel I have much problems with dynamic languages. I develop at the REPL, and then turn it into scripts/functions.
2020-03-14 14:20:46	BjrnLinseGitter[	though it it is a matter of scale of couse. as soon as you delevop huge codebases, you want statistically typed interfaces.
2020-03-14 14:20:55	BenJacksonGitter	exactly
2020-03-14 14:21:08	BenJacksonGitter	vim, emacs, they're huge codebases
2020-03-14 14:21:28	BenJacksonGitter	huge meaning anything more than about 1 or 2 screens of code
2020-03-14 14:22:14	BenJacksonGitter	then again, i write a lot of stuff in python, which is one of the worst offenders to type systems
2020-03-14 14:22:25	BenJacksonGitter	and i do that by choice, so stfu puremourning
2020-03-14 14:22:53	BjrnLinseGitter[	well it is a matter of structure also. LIke the LSP lua client have a small core, and most code are method specific stuff.
2020-03-14 14:23:24	BjrnLinseGitter[	like the different methods don't interact with each other or define interfaces (rather consume a JSON interface, so your static type system won't help you :)
2020-03-14 14:24:21	BjrnLinseGitter[	then the fun part is when we use lua code to generate C code, like for all RPC methods.
2020-03-14 14:24:40	BjrnLinseGitter[	still for python, jedi works amazingly well given the language design.

2020-04-12 19:25:50	DheepakKrishnamu	If I use `local floating_window_scaling_factor = api.nvim_get_var("lazygit_floating_window_scaling_factor")` to get an option set in vimscript, if the value is a integer (i.e. `1`) I get a number `1` in lua, but if the value is `0.9` in vimscript, I get a table with `true` and `false` as keys and values `3` and `0.9`? Why do I get a table for vimscript options that are floating point? what is the true and false in
2020-04-12 19:25:51	DheepakKrishnamu	the table supposed to mean? and is there a cleaner way to get an option that might be integer or floating point from vimscript into lua?
