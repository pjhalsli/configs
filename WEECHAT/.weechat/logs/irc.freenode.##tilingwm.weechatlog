2019-09-26 23:01:48	@penguin1	*slow
2019-09-26 23:01:57	@voidead	you mean mosh/tmux?
2019-09-26 23:02:15	@penguin1	#tmux
2019-09-26 23:02:20	@voidead	ah
2019-09-26 23:02:22	@voidead	yeah
2019-09-26 23:02:24	@voidead	the channel
2019-09-26 23:02:28	@penguin1	yup
2019-09-26 23:03:24	@penguin1	its an awesome program and I learned more yesterday than in a whole year
2019-09-26 23:03:44	@voidead	yeah my main setup is mosh/tmux
2019-09-26 23:03:51	@voidead	mosh for remote connections of course
2019-09-26 23:04:12	@penguin1	on a clean nstall my two first things is vim and tmux
2019-09-26 23:04:22	@penguin1	then I can live in tty
2019-09-26 23:04:51	@voidead	I usually have htop running in tmux with multiple other windows running too
2019-09-26 23:05:13	@voidead	I'll have processes running etc..
2019-09-26 23:05:18	@voidead	tmux is very useful
2019-09-26 23:05:46	@penguin1	yeah I use it for wechat  -rtv and ncmpcpp - i have a spwcific ws for monitor programs
2019-09-26 23:06:00	@penguin1	*specific
2019-09-26 23:06:10	@voidead	but if I'm doing something on my phone to my computer at home its good to have mosh for when some shitty ass wifi connection decides to randomly stop working
2019-09-26 23:06:36	@penguin1	whats mosh?
2019-09-26 23:06:48	@voidead	it utilizes ssh
2019-09-26 23:07:01	@penguin1	aah I never tried ssh
2019-09-26 23:07:10	@voidead	but it allows the connection to be broken or the ip change or something.. yet still stay connected once you get the connection again
2019-09-26 23:07:32	@voidead	https://mosh.org/
2019-09-26 23:07:45	@penguin1	I alwayshave a lappy with me so no need for ssh
2019-09-26 23:07:54	@voidead	ssh and mosh are very similar except your connection may drop using ssh
2019-09-26 23:08:06	@penguin1	ok
2019-09-26 23:08:20	@voidead	but like if you are connecting to a VPS or remote machine from your laptop or phone or anything
2019-09-26 23:08:24	@voidead	doesn't matter what device
2019-09-26 23:08:35	@voidead	you can stay connected regardless of wifi or whatever
2019-09-26 23:09:02	@penguin1	oh thats nice
2019-09-26 23:09:07	@voidead	I've had multiple situations where mosh came in handy
2019-09-26 23:09:16	@voidead	especially when I've traveled to other countries
2019-09-26 23:09:29	@voidead	you never know when something is going to fuck up
2019-09-26 23:09:55	@penguin1	we start rolling out 5g in november   :)
2019-09-26 23:10:09	@voidead	but like I said
2019-09-26 23:10:13	@voidead	it doesn't matter
2019-09-26 23:10:19	@voidead	you'll still get disconnected at some point
2019-09-26 23:10:25	@voidead	so its best to prevent that
2019-09-26 23:10:26	@voidead	use mosh
2019-09-26 23:11:20	@penguin1	hmmm might look into it . I have so many things I should check out. My to do list have become abook
2019-09-26 23:12:17	@voidead	my main essentials are pretty much mosh/tmux/weechat and whatever else I want running
2019-09-26 23:12:45	@voidead	I use ssh when I'm on LAN though
2019-09-26 23:12:56	@penguin1	they been testing 5 g for 2 years now and whatthey say is that its really good so the major cities get it in nov and the rest  of the country from jan
2019-09-26 23:12:57	@voidead	no reason to use mosh in that regard
2019-09-26 23:13:12	@voidead	also for example
2019-09-26 23:13:24	@voidead	if you are switching between wifi and 5G or whatever
2019-09-26 23:13:28	@voidead	you'll lose your connection
2019-09-26 23:13:31	@voidead	unless you use mosh
2019-09-26 23:13:45	@penguin1	yeah that's an issue
2019-09-26 23:13:48	@voidead	I can't believe you've never tried ssh/mosh
2019-09-26 23:14:09	@voidead	you can remotely connect to your computers from anywhere and do whatever you want
2019-09-26 23:14:11	@voidead	shut them down
2019-09-26 23:14:12	@penguin1	so with mosh you stay conneted even if yo switch connection
2019-09-26 23:14:13	@voidead	play music
2019-09-26 23:14:15	@voidead	whatever
2019-09-26 23:14:19	@voidead	right
2019-09-26 23:14:26	@penguin1	cool
2019-09-26 23:18:54	@penguin1	you knowof ant good bitmap fonts that work fine on 1080 screens?
2019-09-26 23:19:06	@penguin1	I use Gohu
2019-09-26 23:19:36	@voidead	meh
2019-09-26 23:19:41	@voidead	I just use source code pro
2019-09-26 23:19:48	@voidead	for monospaced fonts
2019-09-26 23:25:35	@penguin1	I use SCP for non term programs
2019-09-26 23:26:45	@penguin1	bitmap are so small on 1080 screens but gohufont are available up to 14 px
2019-09-26 23:28:36	@penguin1	I hate go programs - always so massive dependicies

2019-10-06 21:59:06	@penguin1	do you use dunst with IRC?  It works better than I anticipated
2019-10-06 21:59:36	@voidead	nah I hate notifications
2019-10-06 21:59:48	@voidead	I see it when I see it
2019-10-06 21:59:55	@penguin1	it's nice to have 
2019-10-06 22:00:12	@penguin1	I always missed msg's - but not anymore
2019-10-06 22:00:27	@voidead	well when I'm engaged in a conversation I'll pay attention to the conversation enough so I don't need notifications
2019-10-06 22:00:33	@penguin1	you're right ofc - I c it when I c it   :)
2019-10-06 22:00:34	@voidead	I never miss messages
2019-10-06 22:00:44	@voidead	if I don't answer its because I don't want to answer
2019-10-06 22:00:50	@penguin1	you never sleep?
2019-10-06 22:01:12	@voidead	I still don't miss messages though
2019-10-06 22:01:18	@penguin1	haha
2019-10-06 22:01:22	@voidead	I'll see them when I wake up
2019-10-06 22:01:26	@voidead	my computer never sleeps
2019-10-06 22:01:29	@voidead	thats the point
2019-10-06 22:01:44	@penguin1	I got used to notifications when using telegram and thought it was quite nice
2019-10-06 22:01:47	@voidead	why should people expect me to answer
2019-10-06 22:02:24	@penguin1	lol - do you expect an answer?
2019-10-06 22:02:29	@voidead	thats another reason I hate notifications is because when I don't want to answer its annoying as fuck to have some notifications bothering me all the fucking time
2019-10-06 22:03:04	@voidead	plus I mean these channels are dead as fuck anyways
2019-10-06 22:03:07	@voidead	not like it matters
2019-10-06 22:03:15	@voidead	fucking flaky ass people
2019-10-06 22:03:19	@voidead	too spastic
2019-10-06 22:03:35	@penguin1	ok - I've set mine to only 2 secs so I just see it whenever I'm on another workspace
2019-10-06 22:05:06	@voidead	penguin1› to answer the turntable question
2019-10-06 22:05:09	@voidead	it would be digital
2019-10-06 22:05:12	@voidead	confirmed
2019-10-06 22:05:38	@voidead	so that means basically you need a receiver or some device to amplify your signal so it stays analog
2019-10-06 22:05:44	@penguin1	yup thought so - it's math really.   
2019-10-06 22:05:46	@penguin1	yes
2019-10-06 22:07:23	@penguin1	I've seen these digital turntables - I wonder why ppl buy them?
2019-10-06 22:08:03	@penguin1	or
2019-10-06 22:08:26	@penguin1	I think they were digital - I can't see that they are analog
